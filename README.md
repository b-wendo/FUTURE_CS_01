# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Implementation

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to enhance the security of a sample web application. By requiring a time-based one-time password (TOTP) in addition to a standard username and password, this system provides an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access.

## Features
- Generate and display a QR code for TOTP setup.
- Verify TOTP tokens generated by authenticator apps like Google Authenticator or Authy.
- Secure storage and retrieval of 2FA secrets.
- Error handling for invalid or expired tokens.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pyotp` for generating and verifying TOTP tokens.
  - `qrcode` for creating QR codes.
  - `Flask` for web application development.
- **Database**: SQLite

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- A virtual environment (recommended)
- Google Authenticator or any TOTP-compatible app

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bwendo/2fa-project.git
   cd 2fa-project
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Access the application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage
1. Register an account on the application.
2. Set up 2FA by scanning the provided QR code with an authenticator app.
3. During login, enter the TOTP from the authenticator app in addition to your username and password.
4. If the token is valid, access is granted. If invalid, an error message is displayed.

## Testing
- **Valid Token**: Test with a correct token to confirm successful login.
- **Invalid Token**: Test with expired or incorrect tokens to ensure access is denied.
- **Edge Cases**: Test reusing tokens or entering multiple tokens within the same time window.
