## Project Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to enhance the security of a sample web application. By requiring a time-based one-time password (TOTP) in addition to a standard username and password, this system provides an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access. The project is developed as part of the FUTURE Interns remote internship program.


### Importance and Benefits of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

1. **Enhanced Security**:  
   2FA adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords. Even if a hacker obtains your password through phishing or data breaches, they still need the second factor (like a code from your phone) to access your account.

2. **Reduced Risk of Account Compromise**:  
   2FA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to your accounts, protecting your sensitive data from theft or misuse.

3. **Protection Against Phishing Attacks**:  
   Phishing attacks often rely on tricking users into revealing their passwords. 2FA makes these attacks less effective as hackers need both the password and the second factor.

4. **Increased Trust and Confidence**:  
   Implementing 2FA demonstrates a commitment to user security and builds trust between users and the service provider.

5. **Compliance**:  
   In many industries, 2FA is becoming a regulatory requirement to comply with data protection standards like GDPR and CCPA.

## Features
- Generate and display a QR code for TOTP setup.
- Verify TOTP tokens generated by authenticator apps like Google Authenticator or Authy.
- Secure storage and retrieval of 2FA secrets.
- Error handling for invalid or expired tokens.
- User login functionality.
- Simple, user-friendly design.

## Technology Used
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.12.8
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pyotp` for generating and verifying TOTP tokens.
  - `qrcode` for creating QR codes.
  - `Flask` for web application development.
- **Database**: SQLite

## Setup and Installation

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- A virtual environment (recommended)
- Google Authenticator or any TOTP-compatible app

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/b-wendo/FUTURE_CS_01
   cd 2fa-project
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Access the application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage
1. Register an account on the application.
2. Set up 2FA by scanning the provided QR code with an authenticator app.
3. During login, enter the TOTP from the authenticator app in addition to your username and password.
4. If the token is valid, access is granted. If invalid, an error message is displayed.

## Testing
- **Valid Token**: Test with a correct token to confirm successful login.
- **Invalid Token**: Test with expired or incorrect tokens to ensure access is denied.
- **Edge Cases**: Test reusing tokens or entering multiple tokens within the same time window.
